# InfoDisplay

This project was made to drive a Raspberry Pi connected to a spare monitor. The program itself loads json files to determine the format and content of elements to be displayed. It is also possible to user-defined scripts to provide images or text to be rendered. 

The project uses PyGame under the hood, so any computer with it should be able to run it. There is no kind of security protection for the user-defined scripts, so keep that in mind if you mean to use this.
